      <small>Virat Kohli</small>

      <p>A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup
        at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies,
        Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast..</p>

      <h3>My Inspration</h3>

      <p>He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In the absence of the regular openers,
        Virat Kohli was given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in his
        extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However, the established and formidable pair
        of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team

        The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly demonstrating that he belonged at
        a much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for
        the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match
        temperament' to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team
        to a clinical victory. The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the
        tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in
        the selectors' minds.</p>
